# SCALE DETECTOR
little script that finds a scale given a set of notes

**how it works**:
- insert notes using space as separator
- insert notes with the English-speaking notation (C D E F etc.)
- insert the alteration symbol (# or b) after the note (i.e. Cb D#)
- don't mix alteration symbols (no b and # in the same input)

it returns all the scales using those notes
